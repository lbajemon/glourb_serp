### glourb_serp

The glourb_serp repository aims at collecting, cleaning and analysing data relative to Google searches. SERP stands for Search Engine Results Pages and corresponds to the pages displayed in response to a query on a search engine, e.g. Google: ![A diagram showing the structure of a Search Engine Results Page](https://github.com/lbajemon/glourb_serp/figures/SERP_structure.png)

The Value SERP API ([access link](https://get.valueserp.com/try-it-free/)) is used to collect raw data. The first 100 queries are free but an account must be created. Diverse parameters are entered in the API and the query is ran accordingly: ![A diagram showing the entered parameters](https://github.com/lbajemon/glourb_serp/figures/query_parameters_diagram.png)

The queries will be ran for a list of rivers and cities combinations, which have been selected as part of the GloUrb research project (funded by the French National Research Agency, nÂ° ANR-22-CE03-0005).
